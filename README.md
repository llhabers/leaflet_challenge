### Situation<br>
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.<br>

### Task<br>
1. Visualize an earthquake data set.<br>
2. Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.<br>
3. Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.<br>
4. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.<br>
5. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.<br>

### Action<br>
I used the following tools to create my map displaying earthquakes that took place in the last 30 days.<br>
1.<br>
2.<br>
3.<br>
4.<br>
The challenge was creating three functions for the following,<br> 
1. Function 1 for styling.<br>
2. Function 2 for color.<br>
3. Function 3 for radii of each earthquake.<br>
